Arsen Stebelskyy – QA Engineer Portfolio
----------------------------------------

"If it’s not flawless, it doesn’t ship."

I break software before users can. My passion for quality assurance is driven by precision, automation, and the relentless pursuit of zero-defect releases.

Welcome to my QA Engineer portfolio repository. Here, I showcase my journey in software quality engineering, featuring  automated test cases and CI/CD integrations that prove my commitment to delivering rock-solid software.

About Me
I’m Arsen Stebelskyy, a QA Engineer with 5+ years of experience ensuring high-quality software across web and mobile applications.

I started my career driven by a single principle: software must earn the right to go live. Over the years, I’ve combined manual testing expertise with powerful automation frameworks to ensure speed and reliability in every release.

Currently at Sportendo, I reduced regression time by 35% and built a Cypress POM framework integrated with GitHub Actions CI/CD.

Previously at Argo AI, I strengthened API, integration, and E2E testing, cutting production defects by 20%.

I thrive in Agile/Scrum environments, collaborating with developers, product owners, and cross-functional teams to ensure bulletproof releases.
